D326 - Advanced Data Management: My class project to create a business problem and solve it using Postgresql and a premade dataset called dvdrental from postgresqls sample DBs.  I created report that determined which genres generate the most revenue and which types of film ratings are rented the most frequently to support optimizing inventory and marketing opportunities for long-term profitable growth.
